Introduction
============

Virtusize is a virtual fitting solution that helps retailers to visually
illustrate the size and fit of clothing online.

Virtusize allows customers to compare specific measurements of an item
they are looking to buy with those of a similar item they already own.

Displaying and overlaying silhouettes of both items then allows
customers to easily compare sizes and choose the one that would fit them
the best. Virtusize is accessed through a button located on the product
page at the retailer.
