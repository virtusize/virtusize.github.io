Integration Guide
=================

Virtusize is a virtual fitting solution that helps retailers to visually
illustrate the fit of clothing online, offering a personalised shopping
experience.

Virtusize allows customers to compare specific measurements of an item
they are looking to buy with those of a similar item they already own.

Displaying and overlaying silhouettes of both items allows
customers to easily compare sizes and choose the one that they prefer or that
fits them the best. Virtusize is accessed through a button located on the product
page of a retailer’s website
