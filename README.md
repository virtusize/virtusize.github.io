Virtusize developer docs
========================

To generate the docs and push them to the master branch on Github do

    make gh-pages


To build the html in the develop branch for testing before publishing it:

    make html


The Makefile target was derived from http://blog.nikhilism.com/2012/08/automatic-github-pages-generation-from.html
