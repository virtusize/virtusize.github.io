"This will enable Virtusize to show the customers garments they have recently"
" purchased as part of the purchase history. They can then select one or more"
" of these garments as a reference item used for comparison with the garment "
"they are looking to purchase from the retailer at the moment. Doing this "
"will effectively eliminate the tedious task of measuring garments from their"
" wardrobe for the customers and will therefore make it much easier for the "
"customer to get started with using Virtusize."

"At this moment, the order confirmation has only one dependency, jQuery 1.3 "
"or later.  If jQuery is not found on the page, the script will "
"asynchronously load jQuery from the Google CDN (this will not slow down the "
"page as it is done asynchronously and most clients already have it cached)."

"All script loading is done asynchronously, minimizing the impact on the load"
" speed of the product page. The integration snippet is inspired by the "
"asynchronous loading done by Google Analytics, FB Connect, Google+ and "
"others. In the unlikely event of Virtusize servers experiencing down time, "
"the product page will not be impacted other than that the button won't show."

msgid ""
"Virtusize order confirmation consists of a small JavaScript, that retailer "
"can include in their order confirmation pages. The retailer will supply "
"Virtusize with a number of useful information, that is relevant for finding "
"the perfect size and fit for the customers of the retailer."

"You can start providing purchase data as soon as you have received your API "
"key. This way your customers will benefit as soon as you integrate Virtusize"
" on your product pages. They will already have purchase history from their "
"previous purchases in place."

"After the order confirmation script loads, it will create one or more "
"tracking pixels and insert them into the retailers page. That way the given "
"information will get passed on to Virtusize. Our servers will store the "
"order data and connect it to the current customer."
