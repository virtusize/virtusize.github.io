Introduction
------------

Virtusize helps retailers to illustrate the size and fit of clothing, shoes and bags
online, by letting customers compare the measurements of an item they want to buy
(on a retailer's product page) with an item that they already own (a reference
item). This is done by comparing the silhouettes of the retailerâ€™s product with
the silhouette of the customer's reference Item. Virtusize is a widget which
opens when clicking on the Virtusize button, which is located next to the size
selection on the product page.
